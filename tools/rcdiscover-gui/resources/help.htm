<H2><a name="discovery" id="discovery">Discovery of <em>rc_visard</em> devices</a></H2>
<p>Devices that are powered up and connected to the local network or directly to a
computer can be found using the standard GigE Vision ® discovery mechanism. 
At startup of the rcdiscover-gui tool, all available <em>rc_visard</em> devices are
listed with their name, serial number, current IP, and unique MAC address. The
discovery tool finds all devices reachable with global broadcasts. Thus, devices
located in different subnets than the computer may also be listed. An icon in the
discovery tool indicates whether such devices are actually reachable via a
web browser.</p>

<p>After successful discovery, a double click on the device row opens the Web GUI of the device in
the default web browser of the operating system. To rescan the network, click <em>Rerun Discovery</em>.</p>

<H2><a name="reset" id="reset">Reset of a misconfigured <em>rc_visard</em></a></H2>

<p>Using the <em>Reset rc_visard</em> button in the discovery tool, one can reset
misconfigured devices by following below instructions.</p>

<ol>
<li>The reset mechanism is available for two minutes after device startup only. Thus,
a reboot of the <em>rc_visard</em> may be required before being able to reset the device.</li>
<li>If the misconfigured <em>rc_visard</em> is still successfully detected by the discovery
tool, one can select it from the <em>rc-visard</em> drop down menu. Otherwise,
the <em>rc_visard</em>'s MAC address, which is printed on the device, may be entered manually in the designated fields.</li>
<li>By clicking one of the four buttons, specific modules can be reset:<ul>
<li><a name="reset-parameters" id="reset-parameters"><em>Reset Parameters</em></a>: Reset <em>rc_visard</em> parameters that are configurable via
Web GUI (e.g., frame rate).</li>
<li><a name="reset-gige" id="reset-gige"><em>Reset GigE</em></a>: Reset GigE Vision ® settings (network configuration and user defined name).</li>
<li><a name="reset-all" id="reset-all"><em>Reset All</em></a>: Reset <em>rc_visard</em> parameters as well as GigE Vision ® parameters.</li>
<li><a name="switch-partitions" id="switch-partitions"><em>Switch Partitions</em></a>: Allows to perform a rollback the the previous firmware.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A successful reset is indicated by a white status LED followed by a device
reboot. If no reaction is noticable, the two minutes time slot mentioned in step 1
may have closed, requiring another reboot. Moreover, repeating step 3 multiple
times often is useful.</li>
