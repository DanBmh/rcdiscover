<p>Devices that are powered up and connected to the local network or directly to a
computer can be found using the standard GigE Vision ® discovery mechanism. 
At startup, all available <em>rc_visard</em> devices are
listed with their name, serial number, current IP, and unique MAC address. The
discovery tool finds all devices reachable by global broadcasts. Misconfigured devices that are
located in different subnets than the computer may also be listed. An icon in the
discovery tool indicates whether devices are actually reachable via a
web browser. A rescan can be initiated by clicking on <em>Rerun Discovery</em></p>

<p>After successful discovery, a double click on the device row opens the Web GUI of the device in
the default web browser of the operating system.</p>

<H2><a name="reset" id="reset">Resetting configuration</a></H2>

<p>A misconfigured device can be reset by using the <em>Reset rc_visard</em> button in the
discovery tool. The reset mechanism is only available for two minutes
after device startup. Thus, a reboot of the <em>rc_visard</em> may be required before
being able to reset the device.</p>

<p>If the misconfigured <em>rc_visard</em> is still successfully detected by the discovery
tool, it can be selected from the <em>rc_visard</em> drop down menu. Otherwise,
the <em>rc_visard</em>'s MAC address, which is printed on the device label, can be entered
manually in the designated fields.</p>

<p>After entering the MAC address one of four options can be chosen:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reset Parameters</em>: Reset all <em>rc_visard</em> parameters that are configurable via the Web GUI (e.g., frame rate).</li>
<li><em>Reset Network</em>: Reset network settings and user defined name.</li>
<li><em>Reset All</em>: Reset <em>rc_visard</em> parameters as well as network settings and user defined name.</li>
<li><em>Switch Partitions</em>: Allows to perform a rollback to the previous firmware.</li>
<ul>
</p>

<p>
A successful reset is indicated by a white status LED followed by a device reboot.
If no reaction is noticable, the two minutes time slot may have passed, requiring
another reboot.
